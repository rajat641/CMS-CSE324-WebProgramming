# Content Management System using PHP
This repository was created to learn the fundamentals of PHP with MySQL by developing
real-world web applications namely a working content management system.
This was done as a part as an individual project for an undergraduate course namely CSE 324(Internet and Web Programming) 
which I took at VIT, Vellore, India.
The following key features were implemented in this project -
* Secure user authentication (login/logout)
* Working with cookies and sessions
* Hiding content from the public view
* Building dynamic content navigation

The WAMP stack consisting of Microsoft Windows operating system, Apache web server, OpenSSL for SSL support, MySQL database and PHP programming language was used to build this website.

Few Visual Designs of the website are as follows:
