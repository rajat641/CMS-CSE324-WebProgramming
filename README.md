# Content management system using PHP
This repository was created to learn the fundamentals of PHP with MySQL by developing
real-world web applications namely a working content management system.
This was done as a part as a individual project for an undergraduate course namely CSE 324(Internet and Web Programming) 
which I took at VIT, Vellore, India.
The following ket features were implemented in this project -
* Secure user authentication (login/logout)
* Working with cookies and sessions
* Hiding content from the public view
* Building dynamic content navigation
